# string-selector

This extension allows to quickly select text within strings delimited by single or double quotes. Priority is given to double quotes.
The selection is triggered by the shortcut `extension.selectTextInQuotes` which is by default `ctrl+q`.

## install
Use the `.visx` file in the `release` folder.
